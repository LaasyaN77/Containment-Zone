# 🛡️ Containment Zone — Polygon Point Checker

This project is an interactive GUI-based application where users can define a polygon and input multiple points to determine whether those points lie inside or outside the polygon. 🔍

Key Features:

- 🧮 Input System: users can enter any number of vertices to define a polygon (minimum 3).

- Each point is checked using geometric algorithms, and the results are displayed:                                  
      🟢 dots = Inside the polygon
